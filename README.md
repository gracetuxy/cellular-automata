# Project 2: Cellular Automata.

In this project, I recreate two classic examples of cellular automata, namely, [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)
and [Cyclic CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_cellular_automaton) in the 'lifeStu.py' file and added my own version of cellular automata in the 'Creative.py' file. The rules for my game are explained in the 'gol.md' file.

All the games have 3 main components:

1. Initializer - Determines the initial state of the game
2. Rule - Determines how the states change
3. Neighbour - Determines each cell's neighbouring cells
